## Badass Runtime Plugin Example: JavaFX Application ##

A small JavaFX 11 non-modular application that shows how to use the [Badass Runtime Plugin](https://github.com/beryx/badass-runtime-plugin/).

It allows you to create a custom runtime image of your application and a platform-specific installer for it.

### Usage
**Running with gradle:**
```
./gradlew run
```

The following window should appear on the screen:

**Creating and executing a custom runtime image:**
```
./gradlew runtime
cd build/image/bin
./hellofx
```


**Creating a platform-specific installer:**
```
./gradlew jpackage
```

The above command will generate the platform-specific installers in the `build/jpackage` directory.
